# Split Keyboard
Fully custom split mechanical keyboard. Runs on ZMK software, controlling key functions and responsive lighting. Future iterations intend to use ultra low-profile switches and a case redesign to allow the two sides to fold together for portability. Firmware updates plan to incorporate layers and macros once the author thinks of what to use so many keys for. 


## PCB
Designed in Kicad

## Case  
3d printed case desinged using Fusion 360. Multiple parts designed for printing with minimal supports. Designed such that no mounting holes needed in pcb. 
## Firmware  
Macropad runs on ZMK software.  
- Split keyboard Bluetooth connection
- 44 keys, full keyboard functionality
- Reactive key leds with fade out effects

To-Do
- Multiple layers for different day-to-day needs. Custom key to easily cycle between layers. Indicate current layer with rgb change.
